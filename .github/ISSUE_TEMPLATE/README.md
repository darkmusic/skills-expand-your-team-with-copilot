- **Be specific**: The more details you provide, the better
- **Be clear**: Use simple, direct language
- **Include examples**: Screenshots or examples help a lot
- **Explain why**: Context helps ensure the change is done correctly
- **One topic per issue**: Don't combine multiple unrelated requests

## Getting Help

If you're not sure which template to use, or if your request doesn't fit any template:
- You can still create a blank issue
- Ask questions in the Discussions section
- Contact the system administrator

## For Copilot Coding Agent

Each template includes:
- **Clear problem description**: What needs to be done
- **Acceptance criteria**: What success looks like
- **Technical hints**: Specific files and code patterns to use
- **Limitations**: Constraints to follow (HTML/CSS/JS/Python only, simple maintainable code)

The templates ensure enough context for the Copilot coding agent to complete tasks independently.
